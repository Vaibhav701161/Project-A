📌 Project Name: LocADo – Local Ads, Delivered Organically

🧠 Overview
LocADo is a location-based influencer collaboration platform that connects local businesses with local influencers for authentic, hyper-targeted marketing campaigns. It bridges the gap between small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) looking to boost visibility within a community and local micro-influencers who hold real sway over that audience.

Rather than relying on expensive celebrity endorsements or untargeted ads, LocADo empowers businesses to run efficient, ROI-driven campaigns through trusted local voices.

🔍 Problem Statement
Small businesses — especially those dealing in tangible, experience-driven products like cafes, boutiques, fitness studios, home decor, and salons — face three core challenges:

Lack of visibility in the digital crowd.

Limited budgets for professional marketing.

Inefficient or unscalable word-of-mouth marketing.

On the other side, local influencers (nano/micro-influencers with 1K–20K followers) often struggle to find paid brand deals and collaborations, especially within their immediate geographic circle.

💡 Solution
LocADo provides a unified platform for:

📍 Geo-targeted collaboration discovery: Businesses can find influencers in their local area based on filters like niche, follower count, engagement rate, and past collaborations.

📣 Campaign Posting System: Businesses can create campaigns specifying deliverables, budget, type (barter/paid/mixed), and timeline. Influencers can apply, negotiate, or auto-accept based on eligibility.

🔗 Verified Influencer Profiles: Integration with APIs like Instagram Graph API allows automatic verification of follower counts, engagement metrics, niche categories, and location authenticity.

💬 Real-time Messaging: A built-in chat system facilitates transparent, on-platform communication between influencers and businesses.

💳 Secure Payment Handling: Escrow-enabled payments via Stripe/PayPal/Razorpay ensure secure transactions and milestone-based payouts. Commission cuts for the platform can be automated.

📊 Dashboard & Analytics: Both parties get access to simple dashboards with campaign performance, application statuses, income reports, and insights.

🎯 Target Audience
Local Businesses: Cafes, home decor stores, fashion outlets, salons, gyms, and event planners.

Local Influencers: Lifestyle bloggers, college influencers, food reviewers, fitness creators, photographers, etc.

Event-based campaigns: Pop-ups, workshops, and product launches seeking regional reach.
